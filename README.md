Submitted by: Jigyasaa(JJ) Sood

Time spent: 50 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- added a custom tip amount textfield on the settings page so that the user can input any amount of tip they want(for exmaple, 23.78% or   34%) other than the basic default ones listed on the main app page. The updated custom tip will be shown on the main app page. I added   an update button the settings page that updates the data of the custom tip. 
- added a default tip setting on the main page
- added gradient color to the background and buttons
